 Files to submit jobs in the DESY cluster is given in this
 directory. 

 1. Open the file "start.sh". This has a for loop which
    loops over the lattice sizes for which the run is to
    be submitted. It makes a separate directory for each
    executable/parameter and copies all the relevant files
    and executables inside the directory. 

 2. Inside the relevant directory, it replaces a dummy
    parameter in the parameter file (called submitQ3) with
    the relevant parameters (using 'sed' command).

 3. The relevant job file which submits the job is 
    relabelled and used to launch the job using the qsub
    command.

 4. The shell sleep a while and the launches the next job
    with the next set of parameters.

  Using a double for-loop you can also launch all the jobs
 in one go.
