1. Oflip = < \sum_plaq f_\plaq^2 >;
    with f_\plaq = 1 if the plaquette is flippable, and 0 if not.

 2. Oflipp is the observable which we thought was eq(10) of 1807.00826 (but
    without the normalization factor)
    Oflipp = < \sum_\plaq (-1)^(n+m) f_\plaq^2 >
    --- note the placement of the expectation values.

 3. MA and MB is eq (28) in our notes. This observable, surprisingly, gives
    the result, as I expected it to. The sum of MA and MB is zero.

 4. eA and eB is the same as Oflip but measured only on a single sub-lattice.
